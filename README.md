# LoopsCollectionsWorkout

This project is a Java application created on Eclipse that demonstrates the use of loops and collections in Java programming. It includes classes that showcase various looping techniques and the use of collections like arrays and maps.

## Usage

This application showcases the use of loops for iterating through double-dimensional arrays, maps, and string arrays. It demonstrates the functionality of looping constructs and the manipulation of different types of data structures.

## Requirements

- Java
- Eclipse IDE

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Eclipse.
3. Run each of the classes, `doubleDimensionArray`, `MapLoop`, and `StringArrayLoop`, to see the output demonstrating various looping techniques and collection manipulations.

## Classes

### doubleDimensionArray

A class that demonstrates looping through a double-dimensional array and printing the elements.

### MapLoop

A class that showcases the use of the Map data structure in Java. It demonstrates adding elements to a map, iterating through the map using different approaches, and printing the elements.

### StringArrayLoop

A class that demonstrates the use of loops with string arrays. It showcases looping through string arrays, converting elements to strings, and printing various details related to the string array.
